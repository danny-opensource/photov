1. We set the ramp up to 50000. Total users as 10,000. i.e, each user hits the server at an interval of 5 sec.
2. We initially set the CPU% to 90% and recorded the throughput. We repeated by changing to 80%, 60% and 30% and recorded the throughput.
3. We then changed the ramp up to 40000. Total users 10000. Repeated the same and recorded the throughput.
4.Repeat by changing ramp up to 30000, 20000, 10000. Observe the variation of throughput
